<h2>Jobs Hunter Front-End Overview </h2>

<p>
Job Hunters removes the friction of having to visit multiple job platforms or search your inbox to find your dream job! 
</p>

<p>
The Jobs Hunter application solves the problem of job seekers searching for jobs online and not having a simple way to save the jobs they are interested in. As employers distribute jobs across the internet, job seekers can come across jobs anywhere. Prior to Job Hunters, one of the ways to save a job was to email yourself the link.

Users can add the company name, job title, role description and a link to the online application. The added jobs are then saved to the “Jobs Inbox.” A user can directly access the job link to apply and update their jobs inbox to reflect so.

There is a total of four component routes for the NavBar, Login/Authorization, Create a new job form and a route to show the job details. For CSS styling, we utilized React-Materialize for a clean, modern and professional look.
